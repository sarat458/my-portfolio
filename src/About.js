                Iâ€™m a software engineer with over 4 years of work-experience in web-development,
                automations and production support. I did my under-graduation in Electronics and communication
                engineering and post my bachelorsâ€™ study I switched my interest towards the computer
                science field and wanted to pursue a masters degree in Computer Science. My interest towards computer
                science began during the internship stint at DRDL where i worked as Matlab GUI developer. To align with rigorous coursework during Masters, I have been working on improving my problem-solving skills, data structures &amp; algorithms,
                Fundamentals of Database Management Systems, Operating Systems and Software architecture &amp; design.
